# R_Simulations
This folder contains the code used to perform the Simulation study.


## The three steps of the Simulation study

- **Step 1. Data + Survival generation** 

In the file `1_Data_Generation.Rmd` we generate the multivariate data and survival outcomes that will be used in the simulation study. The process is described using latex mark-up with R chunks outputting some intermediary plots.

- **Step 2. Applying and evaluating models on simulated data**

In the file `2_Evaluate_Models.Rmd` the proposed methods are applied to the data resulting from Step 1. Additionally, plots are produced summarizing the performance metrics.

- **Step 3. Additional Exploration**

In the file `3_Additional_Exploration.Rmd` we explore the results a bit further to evaluate some interesting/peculiar results from the second step.

## Figures
Some of the figures from Steps 2 and 3 can be found in the subdirectory `Figures`.
