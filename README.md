# ABCmFPCA
Implementation code for Age-based centered mFPCA


This repository aims to make the results from [Dynamic prediction of survival using multivariate Functional Principal Component Analysis: a strict landmarking approach](www.google.com) reproducible. 
There are two directories, with `R_ADNI_Analysis` showing the code used to obtain results for the [Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/) data and `R_Simulations` showing the code for the simulation study (exactly reproducible).

The two subdirectories are described in more detail below.

## R_ADNI_Analysis

In this directory the code is contained which was used to perform analyses on the [Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/). The results are not exactly reproducible as the data is not publicly available, but can be requested for scientific research. Click the directory for more information. 


## R_Simulations

In this directory the code used to perform the simulation studies can be found. This code is exactly reproducible and depends on a forked version of the original [MFPCA](https://github.com/ClaraHapp/MFPCA) package, which can be found [here](https://github.com/d-gomon/MFPCA). Click the directory for more information.
